				<h3>about the artist</h3>
				<p>Based out of a quaint town south of Boston, Rachel Stanton continues to find the rare greenery left in the city. She pulls her inspiration from the natural world. Her portfolio is a visual representation of her two major interests: nature + music. Especially fond of hiphop and rap, Rachel kept coming across musicians with rap names beginning in 'lil'. Then it hit her. Little Botany was to be her brand [shortened to @lilbotany on twitter & instagram]. What first started as a tongue-in-cheek nod to her favorite artists, soon developed into more. Rachel's portfolio has expanded from botanical illustrations into album artwork for artists like Father, Archibald Slim, and more.</p>

				<h3>the process</h3>
				<p>Whether it's watercolor, colored pencil, or black ink, Little Botany finds a way to illustrate organic matter. After taking a course in botany at university, Rachel started looking at flowers and plants in a different light. <i>Everything starts from life</i> - if she has access to flowers or plants (without disrupting mother nature) she will start drawing. You might see her crouching by a peony bush in Chinatown or visiting local florists and shooting reference photos. Once Little Botany spots the right subject, dreams up her next project, it hits the sketchbook.</p>
